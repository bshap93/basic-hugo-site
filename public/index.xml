      <description>With a focus on clean code, maintainability, testability, and overall code quality, I will focus in on what is most important both long and short-term. I also work as a teacher at a Residential Treatment Center for teenagers dealing with mental health issues. I&amp;rsquo;m a big advocate of neurodiversity in the workplace.
I have worked on a variety of projects that emphasize the variety of experience I am able to leverage.</description>
